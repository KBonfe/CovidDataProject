# Is the Covid-19 Pandemic Over?

What defines the end of a pandemic?  The New York Times states, "According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes."  Covid-19 is not gone but have we reached the point in our pandemic when it has ended socially?

 Then the question becomes will this pandemic become endemic? Meaning Covid could be around year after year like influenza but will be at a much less severe level.  If that is the case, when do we accept the death rate of Covid as a community and decide that it will no longer affect our day-to-day lives?


This project is a brief look at the Covid death, infection, and vaccination rates gathered from ourworldindata.org.  As you can see from the graphs below all global levels have dropped since Febrary of 2022.
